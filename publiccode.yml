      VVFGeoFleet is a system allowing to track a fleet, where vehicles are
      equipped with GPS enabled devices periodically sending their position. The
      system is composed of two main modules: (i) a backend module, based on a
      RESTful server; (ii) a frontend module, based on an Angular GUI. The
      backend is written in C# Asp.Net WebApi, using Visual Studio 2017
      Community Edition, with a persistence layer based on MongoDB document
      database. It collects position messages coming from GPS enabled devices
      installed on board the vehicles; publishes REST actions to efficiently
      query the collected data. Queries allow, for instance, to: (i) getting the
      current fleet position (also by vehicle class); (ii) getting a vehicle
      position; (iii) getting a vehicle tracked path, within a given time
      interval; (iv) getting vehicles near to a given point (also by vehicle
      class); (v) getting vehicles within a given rectangle; (vi
